// CMPINF 0401 Lab 6 Main Program
// Your job is to complete this program so that it runs correctly.
// The Movie class and MovieDB class have already been completed for you.
// Utilizing data abstraction, you can access/use these classes without
// having to know their implementation details.  However, since you have
// the code for them you certainly can look at the implementations.
// You just need to write the correct code in the 3 passages below.  Some
// comments indicate what you need to do in each case.
