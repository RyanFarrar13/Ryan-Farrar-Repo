---------------------
Printing out "players.txt" again we see how the program execution has updated it.
Lines for Marge and Ingmar have been added to the file and the line for Fezzik has
been updated to reflect the simulated rounds "played" in the program.  Note also
that Inigo's entry is unchanged since he was not authenticated in the program.
