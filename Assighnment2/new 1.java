// Class to store and manipulate scores (use with ex12b.java).  This handout
// also demonstrates sharing of arrays across objects and resizing arrays.
// See more details below.

	private double [] theData;  // Now the array is an instance variable
	private Scanner inScan;     // Allows input scanner to be accessed
								// from within the class

	public Scores(int size, Scanner s)
	{
		theData = new double[size];
		inScan = s;
	}

	// This constructor can make a new object that shares the array
	// (shallow copy) or a new object that has its own array (deep
	// copy).  See the difference in the effect in the ex12b.java program.  
	// We will discuss this in lecture soon.

	// Note that the access methods below are very similar to those
	// in ex12a.java.  However, some important differences exist:
	// 1) The methods are now instance methods (not static as in
	//    ex12a.java)
	// 2) The array is implicit data, so it is not passed in as a
	//    parameter.  Since the array and the method are both part
	//    of the same object, the array can be directly accessed
	//    from within the method.

	// This change is logically equivalent to the change method in ex12a.  It
	// only allows the user to select an index that is valid
	public void change()

	// In this change, we are now allowing an index >= the length of the
	// array.  In this case, we resize the array to enable it to hold the
	// new item.  Note that the resize method is private and is abstracted
	// out of the user's required knownledge.  Note also that if a new
	// array is allocated, it will separate that array from any Scores
	// objects that it may have previously been sharing with.  See more info 
	// below in the resize method.

	}

	// Method to logically resize the Scores array.  Note that we are actually
	// making a new array object and copying the old data into it (because
	// array objects themselves cannot change in size once created).  However,
	// this process is transparent to the user, and the resize method is in
	// fact private.  Thus, the resize is abstracted out and the user of the
	// Scores object does not even know it exists.
	private void resize(int n)
	{
		int min = n;
		if (theData.length < n) min = theData.length;
		double [] temp = new double[n];		// create array of new size
		for (int i = 0; i < min; i++)
		{
			temp[i] = theData[i];			// copy old data into it
		}
		theData = temp;			// set theData reference to new array
	}

	// Note that the sort instance method is simply calling the predefined sort
	// method.  Even though the method here is simple (one line) it is still
	// useful, since it now makes sorting a part of the Scores class rather than
	// keeping it external.
	public void sort()
